My research focuses on computational drug discovery and cardioprotection.  
I integrate in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches to uncover molecular mechanisms underlying ischemiaâ€“reperfusion injury, emphasizing polyphenolic interventions such as fisetin.

### Current Focus
- AI-guided molecular modeling for cardioprotective drug discovery  
- Mitochondrial energetics and bioinformatics in ischemic injury  
- Network pharmacology and translational validation  
- Toxicology and safety evaluation of natural products
