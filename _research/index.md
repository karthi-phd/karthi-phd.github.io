My research explores how small molecules influence biological systems across microbial and mammalian contexts. I focus on understanding how chemical structures translate into biological outcomes, using a combination of computational modeling, systems pharmacology, and experimental validation. This integrative approach bridges mechanism-based drug discovery with translational biology, uniting my two long-standing interests: infectious disease therapeutics and cardioprotective pharmacology.

<h3>Infectious Disease Therapeutics</h3>

<p>
Since the early stages of my academic career, I have been engaged in discovering and designing small molecules that combat microbial virulence and biofilm formation. My work focuses on understanding quorum sensing and signaling networks in pathogens such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. I have applied virtual screening, structure-based drug design, and molecular dynamics simulations to identify quorum sensing inhibitors, anti-biofilm compounds, and peptide mimetics that interfere with pathogen communication and resistance pathways. Several of these studies have contributed to publications in Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics, and ChemistrySelect, highlighting novel strategies to inhibit virulence rather than viability.
</p>

<p>
Beyond drug discovery, my infectious disease research also explores material-based interventions, including smart antimicrobial surfaces and nanoformulations that mitigate bacterial adhesion and colonization. These studies combine molecular modeling with experimental microbiology, reinforcing the translational dimension of my work. Much of this research has been carried out in collaboration with Dr. Adline Princy Solomon and colleagues at the Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases (CRID), SASTRA Deemed University.

<h3>Cardioprotection and Mitochondrial Pharmacology</h3>

<p>
Complementing my anti-infective research, my second major research theme focuses on cardioprotection, specifically the molecular mechanisms that govern myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury. During my doctoral research, I investigated the polyphenol fisetin as a cardioprotective agent capable of stabilizing mitochondrial function and modulating the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway. This work integrated in silico discovery with ex vivo and in vivo validation models, uncovering how natural products can preserve mitochondrial signaling, reduce oxidative stress, and promote cellular resilience during ischemic injury.
</p>

<p>
My ongoing work in this area explores mitochondrial subpopulations, energy metabolism, and the role of signaling kinases such as GSK3β in cardioprotection. Through collaborations with Dr. Gino A. Kurian and other interdisciplinary partners, I continue to investigate the mechanistic basis of mitochondrial dysfunction and to identify natural and synthetic small molecules capable of modulating these processes. This line of research contributes to a broader goal of developing mechanism-driven therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases.

<h3>AI and Systems Pharmacology</h3>

<p>
Building on two decades of experience in molecular modeling, I am now integrating artificial intelligence, machine learning, and network pharmacology into my research workflow. My group employs AI-based molecular descriptor modeling, predictive ADMET analysis, and systems-level data integration to accelerate the identification and optimization of drug candidates. This approach connects chemical informatics with systems biology, enabling the prediction of compound behavior across targets, pathways, and disease models.
</p>

<p>
In parallel, I am developing computational frameworks to map polyphenol-target interactions, predict mitochondrial toxicity, and understand how small molecules reprogram signaling networks. These methods are complemented by experimental collaborations that validate computational hypotheses through biochemical and pharmacological assays. The ultimate goal is to create predictive, mechanism-informed pipelines that shorten the gap between virtual discovery and real-world therapeutic translation.
</p>

<h3>Future Directions and Collaborations</h3>

<p>
Looking ahead, my research aims to deepen the integration of computational and experimental pharmacology. I plan to expand ongoing projects in infectious disease and cardioprotection toward chronic and systemic disease models, while incorporating large-scale data analytics and machine learning to guide hypothesis generation. I am also interested in advancing molecular design for anti-biofilm materials and mitochondrial therapeutics with clinical relevance.
</p>

<p>
I lead and co-supervise several B.Tech, M.Tech, and PhD students whose projects span computational drug design, molecular dynamics, and systems pharmacology. Many of these students have presented at national and international conferences, published in peer-reviewed journals, and continued into research or industry positions. I believe in fostering a collaborative environment where students learn to combine molecular insight with biological context.
</p>

<p>
I welcome interdisciplinary collaborations that unite chemistry, biology, pharmacology, and computational science. Researchers and students interested in computational drug design, network pharmacology, or translational biology are encouraged to connect and explore opportunities for collaborative work.
