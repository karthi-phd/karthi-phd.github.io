### Abstract
Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in mitochondrial gene regulation during ischemia–reperfusion injury. In this study, fisetin was identified as a potent cardioprotective agent that prevents global DNA hypomethylation and preserves mitochondrial transcriptional activity. Integrating computational and experimental approaches, the study provides mechanistic insight into the role of polyphenols in mitochondrial resilience.
