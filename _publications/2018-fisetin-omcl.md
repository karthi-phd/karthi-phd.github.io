### Abstract
Fisetin, a dietary flavonoid, confers cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury. Using Langendorff-perfused rat hearts and complementary computational analyses, we show that fisetin reduces oxidative stress, preserves mitochondrial function and structure, and is associated with inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β activity.
