I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA Deemed University, where my research focuses on the data-guided discovery of small molecules that modulate disease biology. I study how chemical structures translate into cellular resilience, with applications spanning infectious diseases and cardiovascular injury.

My scientific journey began with the study of bacterial virulence and antimicrobial resistance, where I used computational modeling to explore mechanisms underlying pathogen survival and adaptation. This work inspired a broader interest in how molecular interactions shape pathophysiological outcomes. During my doctoral research, I extended this systems perspective to identify polyphenol-based cardioprotective compounds that preserve mitochondrial and signaling functions during ischemia and reperfusion injury. Across these projects, my goal has been to bridge computational prediction with mechanistic understanding, creating a translational framework that connects molecular insight with therapeutic innovation.

As an educator, I aim to make computation a natural language of biology. My teaching emphasizes conceptual clarity, quantitative reasoning, and creative inquiry, encouraging students to see patterns that connect molecular design with physiological function. I use data-driven exploration, real-world case studies, and interactive learning tools to help them move from information to insight, preparing them to think critically across disciplines in modern drug discovery.
