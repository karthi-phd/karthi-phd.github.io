### About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Chemical and Biotechnology at SASTRA Deemed University, Tiruchirapalli, where I combine my interests in computational drug discovery, molecular informatics, and translational pharmacology. My work focuses on understanding how small molecules influence disease pathways at both the molecular and systems levels, using an integrated computational and experimental approach.

My doctoral research focused on the discovery of polyphenol-based cardioprotective agents against myocardial ischemiaâ€“reperfusion injury. Using pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and ADMET predictions, I identified natural compounds capable of modulating mitochondrial and signaling pathways associated with cardiac injury. This integrative workflow aims to accelerate the translation of computational insights into therapeutically viable molecules.

Beyond research, I am deeply committed to teaching and mentoring in the computational life sciences. I teach courses such as Drug Informatics and Immunoinformatics, integrating AI-driven pedagogy, data-centric analysis, and problem-based learning. Through this dual focus on discovery and education, I aim to foster an environment where students and collaborators can merge biological insight with computational precision to solve complex biomedical problems.
