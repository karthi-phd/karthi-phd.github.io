### My Vision: Predictive Therapeutics

I am a **Computational Biologist** and Assistant Professor dedicated to accelerating therapeutic innovation at the interface of chemistry and living systems. My core mission is to shift drug development from an iterative, high-cost process to a rapid, data-driven methodology by focusing on **predictive computational biology**.

My professional goal is to translate molecular insights into actionable clinical strategies. I am currently seeking **Postdoctoral Fellowships** where I can apply advanced machine learning and systems pharmacology expertise to high-impact challenges in drug discovery and disease intervention.

### Core Expertise and Research Impact

My research is centered on integrating advanced computational techniques to solve complex biological problems:

* **AI/Machine Learning:** Developing and applying models for hit identification, **toxicity forecasting**, and ADMET prediction, leveraging both deep learning and classical modeling frameworks.
* **Systems Pharmacology:** Employing systems-level approaches to map complex compound-target-disease relationships, moving beyond single-target hypotheses to understand disease mechanisms.
* **Translational Rigor:** My doctoral work combined **computational and experimental methods** to explain the cardioprotective effects of the flavonoid fisetin, specifically demonstrating its role in preserving **mitochondrial function** during ischemic injury. This capacity to blend *in silico* prediction with *in vitro* validation is central to my philosophy.

I thrive in **cross-disciplinary collaboration**, partnering with chemists, clinicians, and microbiologists to ensure computational predictions yield tangible therapeutic insights.

### Academic Leadership and Outreach

Beyond research, I am committed to advancing scientific communication and mentorship:

* **Educator:** As an Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics, I design and teach advanced university courses (Drug Informatics, Immunoinformatics) focused on **problem-based learning** that connects computational reasoning to real-world biomedical challenges.
* **Open Science Leadership:** I founded and lead **Primal Bioinformatics**, a successful digital education initiative. This project demonstrates proven leadership in creating open, accessible resources (video lectures, tutorials) to foster an inclusive, global community for aspiring computational biologists.
