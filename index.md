I am a computational biologist and educator interested in how molecules interact with living systems and how that knowledge can be used to design better therapies.  
At present, I work as an Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics at the School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA Deemed University, India. My research combines molecular modeling, systems pharmacology, and artificial intelligence to explore the links between chemistry and biology in health and disease.

During my Ph.D., I studied the cardioprotective effects of the natural flavonoid fisetin using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. This work helped explain how small molecules preserve mitochondrial function and energy balance during ischemia–reperfusion injury. The experience shaped my broader research philosophy: biology can be better understood and predicted when computation and experimentation are viewed as partners rather than separate disciplines.

My recent projects focus on AI-guided drug discovery, toxicity prediction, and natural product-inspired therapeutics. I am particularly interested in how computational models can forecast biological outcomes before experiments are performed. Much of my work is collaborative, involving chemists, microbiologists, and clinicians, with the goal of translating computational predictions into tangible therapeutic insights.

Teaching is an essential part of my academic life. I teach courses in Drug Informatics and Immunoinformatics, where I encourage students to think critically and apply computational reasoning to biological questions. I enjoy designing problem-based learning sessions that connect algorithms with real-world biomedical challenges.

Outside teaching and research, I lead *Primal Bioinformatics*, a digital education initiative that provides open resources for students interested in computational biology. Through video lectures, tutorials, and community projects, I aim to make scientific learning more open, collaborative, and inclusive.

In essence, my work lies at the interface of computation, chemistry, and biology, driven by a simple goal — to understand how molecular information can be used to prevent or reverse disease.
