  <p>
    Teaching is one of the most meaningful parts of my academic life. I see it not as a transfer of information but as a shared process of discovery — a space where curiosity, computation, and creativity come together to solve biological problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    At <strong>SASTRA University</strong>, I teach and coordinate the courses 
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/drug-informatics/"><strong>Drug Informatics (BIN534)</strong></a> 
    and 
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/immunoinformatics/"><strong>Immunoinformatics (BIN315)</strong></a> 
    for undergraduate and postgraduate students in bioinformatics. 
    These courses introduce students to the principles of 
    <strong>computational drug design</strong>, <strong>structural biology</strong>, and 
    <strong>systems-level modeling</strong>. 
    Each course is structured around practical problem-solving, where students learn not only how to use software but also how to think like scientists — how to frame a question, choose an approach, and interpret data critically.

  <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>

  <p>
    My approach to teaching is guided by three core principles:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Learning through doing:</strong> Students learn computation best when they apply it. Each module includes coding exercises, visualization tasks, and data analysis activities that connect theory to real-world datasets.</li>
    <li><strong>Context before complexity:</strong> I emphasize reasoning before technical mastery. Once students understand <em>why</em> a problem matters, the computational tools become intuitive.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration over isolation:</strong> Modern biology is interdisciplinary. I encourage students to connect molecular modeling, bioinformatics, and systems biology as parts of a unified continuum.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Innovation in the Classroom</h3>

  <p>
    I actively incorporate <strong>AI-assisted learning</strong>, <strong>interactive polls</strong>, and <strong>case-based discussions</strong> to make learning more engaging. 
    Students often design their own docking pipelines, build cheminformatics workflows, or perform network pharmacology analyses as coursework, which frequently evolve into research posters or publications. 
    This approach bridges computational training with real-world problem solving.

  <h3>Mentorship and Student Development</h3>

  <p>
    Beyond lectures, I mentor undergraduate and postgraduate students on computational projects in drug discovery, antimicrobial resistance, and toxicity prediction. 
    Several of these projects have resulted in conference presentations, research papers, and open educational materials. 
    I also promote collaborative learning through <strong>open GitHub repositories</strong> and <strong>problem-based workshops</strong>, helping students develop reproducible research skills early in their careers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Teaching for me is an evolving craft — one that grows with every group of students. 
    I aim to create classrooms where questions are valued over answers, mistakes are treated as experiments, and every student feels capable of contributing to science.
