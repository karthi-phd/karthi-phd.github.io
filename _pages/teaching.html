        <h1>Teaching and Mentorship</h1>

        <p>I view education not merely as a transfer of information but as a shared **process of discovery**, where computation and creativity converge to solve complex biological problems. This commitment extends beyond the lecture hall, serving as proof of my strong **communication and mentorship skills**.</p>

        <h2>Courses and Curriculum Leadership</h2>
        <p>At SASTRA University, I design and coordinate key specialized courses for undergraduate and postgraduate students in Bioinformatics:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>**BIN534 – Drug Informatics:** Focuses on computational drug design, structural biology, and cheminformatics workflows.</li>
            <li>**BIN315 – Immunoinformatics:** Introduces students to systems-level modeling and data analysis in the context of immunology.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My courses are structured around **practical problem-solving**, ensuring students learn not only *how to use* software but *how to think* like scientists—framing questions, choosing appropriate approaches, and interpreting data critically.</p>

        <h2>Teaching Philosophy: Principles of Applied Learning</h2>
        <p>My approach emphasizes skills that are immediately transferable to research, organized by three core principles:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Principle</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Learning Through Doing</strong></td>
                    <td>Modules integrate coding exercises, visualization tasks, and data analysis activities to connect theory to real-world datasets.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Context Before Complexity</strong></td>
                    <td>I emphasize the importance of the biological question first, allowing students to grasp *why* a problem matters before diving into technical mastery.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Integration</strong></td>
                    <td>Modern biology is interdisciplinary. I encourage students to connect molecular modeling, bioinformatics, and systems biology as a unified continuum.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Innovation and Impact</h2>
        <p>I continuously innovate in the classroom to bridge computational training with tangible research outcomes and promote open science:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>**Active Learning:** I incorporate **AI-assisted learning**, interactive polls, and case-based discussions.</li>
            <li>**Project-Based Outcomes:** Students design complex projects (e.g., docking pipelines, cheminformatics workflows) which frequently evolve into successful **research posters or publications**.</li>
            <li>**Mentorship:** I guide students on computational projects in **drug discovery, antimicrobial resistance, and toxicity prediction**. These projects have consistently resulted in conference presentations and peer-reviewed papers.</li>
            <li>**Reproducibility:** I promote collaborative learning through **open GitHub repositories** and problem-based workshops, helping students develop crucial reproducible research skills early in their careers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For me, teaching is an evolving craft where questions are valued over answers, and every student is empowered to contribute meaningfully to science.</p>
