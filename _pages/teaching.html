Teaching is one of the most meaningful parts of my academic life.  
I see it not as a transfer of information but as a shared process of discovery — a space where curiosity, computation, and creativity come together to solve biological problems.

At SASTRA University, I teach and coordinate the courses **Drug Informatics (BIN534)** and **Immunoinformatics (BIN315)** for undergraduate and postgraduate students in bioinformatics. These courses introduce students to the principles of computational drug design, structural biology, and systems-level modeling.  
Each course is structured around practical problem-solving, where students learn not only how to use software but also how to think like scientists — how to frame a question, choose an approach, and interpret data critically.

#### Teaching Philosophy
My approach to teaching is guided by three principles:

1. **Learning through doing:** Students understand computation best when they apply it. Every module includes interactive coding tasks, visualization exercises, or analysis challenges that connect theory to data.  
2. **Context before complexity:** I emphasize scientific reasoning before technical mastery. Once students understand *why* a problem matters, the computational tools become intuitive.  
3. **Integration over isolation:** Modern biology is inherently interdisciplinary. I encourage students to connect molecular modeling, bioinformatics, and systems biology as part of a single continuum.

#### Innovation in the Classroom
I actively incorporate **AI-assisted learning, interactive polls, and case-based discussions** to make learning more dynamic.  
For example, students design their own docking pipelines or perform small network pharmacology projects during coursework, which often evolve into full research projects or publications.  
This hands-on approach helps bridge the gap between computational training and real-world research.

#### Mentorship and Student Development
Beyond lectures, I mentor undergraduate and postgraduate students on computational projects related to drug discovery, antimicrobial resistance, and toxicology.  
Several of these projects have led to conference presentations, research papers, and online educational materials.  
I also promote collaborative learning through **open GitHub repositories** and **problem-based workshops**, helping students build reproducible research habits early in their careers.

Teaching for me is an evolving craft — one that grows with every batch of students.  
I aim to create classrooms where questions are valued over answers, mistakes are seen as experiments, and every student feels capable of contributing to science.
