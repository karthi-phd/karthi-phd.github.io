Teaching has been my childhood dream and continues to be the most fulfilling part of my academic journey. Since 2007, I have been teaching undergraduate and postgraduate students at the School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA Deemed University. Over the years, I have taught a wide range of courses that bridge chemistry, biology, and computation, helping students explore the logic of molecular design and the science behind therapeutic discovery.
</p>

<p>
My teaching philosophy is centered on the belief that learning should nurture both analytical precision and creative curiosity. I encourage students to connect molecular understanding with biological meaning, and to see the continuity between data, mechanism, and medicine. Every course I teach aims to equip learners with the ability to reason scientifically, interpret molecular data, and apply computational thinking to solve complex biomedical problems.
</p>

<p>
I integrate interactive, problem-based learning approaches supported by AI and data-centric tools. In recent years, I have introduced modern content such as AI in drug discovery, machine learning in pharmacology, and computational toxicology into existing syllabi. I also use platforms like PollEverywhere and Mentimeter to encourage active participation, while tools such as Schrödinger, PyMOL, and ChatGPT are used for hands-on demonstrations of molecular modeling and scientific reasoning. These innovations have transformed conventional lectures into collaborative sessions where students engage, analyze, and discover.

The courses I teach reflect both depth and diversity across the disciplines of computational and experimental drug discovery:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="Medicinal_Chemistry_Syllabus.pdf">Medicinal Chemistry</a> — explores drug–receptor interactions, structure–activity relationships, and molecular mechanisms of therapeutics.</li>
  <li><a href="Drug_Design_Syllabus.pdf">Drug Design</a> — introduces principles of rational drug design, including lead identification, optimization, and target validation.</li>
  <li><a href="Immunoinformatics_Syllabus.pdf">Immunoinformatics</a> — focuses on computational approaches for epitope mapping, vaccine design, and immune response modeling.</li>
  <li><a href="Applied_Bioinformatics_Syllabus.pdf">Applied Bioinformatics</a> — covers biological databases, sequence analysis, and the application of bioinformatics tools in drug discovery.</li>
  <li><a href="Molecular_Modelling_Syllabus.pdf">Molecular Modelling and Drug Design</a> — a postgraduate-level course focusing on conformational analysis, molecular docking, and virtual screening.</li>
  <li><a href="Drug_Informatics_Syllabus.pdf">Drug Informatics</a> — integrates cheminformatics, pharmacokinetic modeling, and machine learning approaches in drug development.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Mentorship is an integral part of my teaching identity. I have supervised several B.Tech and M.Tech research projects that bridge computation and biology. Many of my students have gone on to present their work at conferences, publish in peer-reviewed journals, and secure positions in academia and industry. I view each project as an opportunity to cultivate scientific curiosity, independence, and integrity in young researchers.
</p>

<p>
Teaching, to me, is more than delivering knowledge; it is about inspiring inquiry and building confidence in scientific reasoning. I believe that the best classrooms are those where students learn to think critically, collaborate effectively, and find joy in discovery. Through continuous innovation and mentorship, I aim to create a learning environment that connects molecular insight with translational impact, preparing students for a future shaped by data, discovery, and interdisciplinary science.
