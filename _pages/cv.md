## Teaching
I teach and coordinate the following courses at SASTRA Deemed University:

- **BIN 315 – Immunoinformatics**  
  Introduction to immune databases, epitope prediction, and vaccine informatics.  
  [View syllabus](/teaching/immunoinformatics/)

- **BIN 534 – Drug Informatics**  
  Concepts in cheminformatics, QSAR, pharmacophore modeling, and virtual screening.  
  [View syllabus](/teaching/drug-informatics/)

I also design interactive pedagogical resources using AI-driven tools and active learning models, integrating practical computational projects with conceptual understanding.
