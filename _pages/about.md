I am **Dr. Karthi Shanmugam**, **Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics and Drug Design** at the **School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA Deemed University**, India.

My research combines **computational chemistry**, **systems pharmacology**, and **experimental validation** to explore therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular and infectious diseases. I am particularly interested in how small molecules, especially natural products, influence mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and cell-survival pathways. My long-term goal is to connect computational prediction with biological experimentation to identify drug-like molecules with translational potential.

During my doctoral work, *“From Computational Discovery to Mechanistic Validation: Unraveling the Cardioprotective Potential of Fisetin Against Ischemia–Reperfusion Injury”*, I built an integrated workflow that links in silico modeling, preclinical validation, and pathway analysis. This framework now guides much of my current research, which spans **molecular docking**, **molecular dynamics**, **ADMET and QSAR modeling**, **machine-learning–based toxicity prediction**, and **network pharmacology**. Current projects include the discovery of cardioprotective flavonoids, identification of antibiofilm and antimicrobial agents, and computational exploration of polyphenols with therapeutic relevance.

**Teaching** is an essential part of my academic work. I coordinate and teach **Drug Informatics** and **Immunoinformatics**, designing courses that link computational methods with biological and pharmacological concepts. I emphasize research-oriented learning, active classroom engagement, and data-driven thinking. Many of my students have gone on to publish their work or pursue higher studies in bioinformatics, medicinal chemistry, and related fields.

I am committed to **open science and public engagement**. Through my GitHub repositories and my educational platform, **Primal Bioinformatics**, I share tutorials, workflows, and discussions that make computational drug design and systems biology more accessible to young researchers.

My academic philosophy is grounded in curiosity, collaboration, and clarity. I believe that good science comes from connecting ideas across disciplines and mentoring the next generation to think critically and communicate effectively.
