<p>
Over the past two decades, my research has focused on bridging computational prediction with biological validation to understand how small molecules influence disease networks. These efforts have resulted in a growing body of peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals, covering topics that span infectious disease therapeutics, cardioprotection, molecular modeling, and systems pharmacology. Collectively, these works reflect an enduring interest in translating molecular insights into therapeutic strategies.
